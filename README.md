# Vylens' PD2 Loot Filter
* Edited and maintained by me, Vylens aka Fluffy.
* Base filter (s9) by [Kryszard](https://www.twitch.tv/kryszard).
* Parts/inspiration from Kassahi and Hiimfilter.
* Credits to [Krampz](https://www.twitch.tv/krampz_) for help and consultation.
* Shoutout to all Filter makers <3 This is a lot of work.
## General stuff, disclaimers, info
Filter is made for all types of players with focus on crafting, Assassin, being educational and helpful.
* Will show lots of magic/rare bases for crafting.
* Never hiding any unique or set, just decrease highlighting/notifications with higher filter levels.
* I use a "tier highlight system" for how good/rare items are. More info under Uniques/Sets.
* Some sounds for relatively/very/super rare items.
* Sample pictures may not be up to date.
## Filter levels and what they're designed to do.
Currently, it is advised to use level 1 or 2 while leveling and up the level later on. By default, certain "trash" items will start to hide between character level 80-90.
* 1 Only hide trash items.
* 2 Early Season/Leveling. Recommended while leveling a new character/ladder resets.
* 3 Slightly Stricter. This is for when you've gotten going a bit, around 2-7 days into the ladder depending on the person. Will start to filter out lesser bases etc.
* 4 Strict with Craft Mats - Recommended. This is the recommended end game filter level. Notifies Crafting materials.
* 5 Even Stricter without Craft Mats. A bit stricter than level 4 in general and no longer notifies craft mats.
* 6 Krampz. This filter level is specifically tailored to my friend Krampz's wants and needs.
* 7 Ultimate Tryhard >:) This filter level hides lots of bases that aren't 15%. Hiding Life and Mana potions. Doesn't notify 2 star uniques. Etc.
## Uniques/Sets
How the "tier highlight" system is designed. Sound notifications are on certain 3/5/7 star items, but not necessarily all.
* 7 STARS - Boss Uniques, Vial, Mirror, Unique Sacred Armors.
Unique Sacred armor is called "IS IT HAPPENING???" or "Another Templar's, my G" if Ethereal.
* 5 STARS - Very rare and high value items.
For example Veil of Steel/Nightwing's Veil, Crown of Ages, Ormus, Griffons, Arach, ethereal Grandfather/Schaefer's.
* 3 STARS - Uncommon, but good items.
Kira's, Harlequin Crest is here but called "Shako is a lie", Larzuk's Puzzlebox etc.
* 2 STARS - Low level or niche items with low value, but commonly used.
Most stuff that is decent will be under this.
* 1 STAR ITEMS.
Very common/niche items/low level items with little value. Most 1 star uniques and sets are like "week 1" items for personal use/merc to get going kinda thing. Like Tempest for Sorc, non eth Gavel.

## Sacred Armors
All Sacred Armors will be named differently. The story and reasoning behind this: I'm mostly called Fluffy and Vylens when it comes to pd2. A while after d2r was released, I started my first Holy Grail and got to the point where Tyrael's Might was the only item left. I found 16x Templar's Might in a row in d2r and then went over to pd2. I got to the same point of the Holy Grail in pd2 (outside of Boss specific items) where I was only missing Tyrael's Might once again. It wasn't until my 16th Unique sacred armor in pd2 (32nd total) that it was finally my first Tyrael's Might. So because of my incredibly unlucky streak is why the filter has these different Sacred Armor names.
* Fluffy's Demise is white, grey, magic and rare.
* Set is Anger Incarnate (3 star).
* Uniques are "IS IT HAPPENING???" or "Another Templar's, my G" if ethereal.
## Magic and Rare Claws.
Claws have a similar tier highlight system as Uniques/Sets with the purposes of being educational and to indicate which are the better/best to craft on. Keep in mind that IAS requirements of the claws can be solved with Burst of Speed, but not necessarily with Fade.
* 2 stars is the best claws to craft on. This includes the War Fist Family (highest physical damage) and Greater Talons (fastest trapsin claw with lowest requirement with Fade in mind).
* 1 star is one of the following with either speed or damage: above average, almost as good as the best or can be upgraded to best (Blade Talons to Greater Talons).
* 0 star is below average, worse than the above or has too high dexteriy requirement for min-maxing (Runic Talons).
## Highlighting on items
* Stats highlighting on Rare/Crafted items.
* Fully dynamic skill display (I call them "skill notes") on items with 4+ to a certain skill. Missing on Barb Helms, Clubs (Barb skills, although unsure if I want to add that), Amazon Bows, Amazon Javelins and Scepters.
* Small highlighting on Facets.
* Good/Bad map affixes. Also shows Immunities and highest resists in maps.
* Resistances of "Added mobs" to maps on Orb of Fortification/Destruction.
* Charms.
## Key
* Quantity 1-26, Runeword recipes.
* Quantity 27, Dclone materials and recommended stats for the encounter.
* Quantity 28, Rathma materials and recommended stats for the encounter.
* Quantity 29, Lucion materials and recommended stats for the encounter.
* Quantity 30, Usual rune values (fluctuates).
* Quantity 31, Usual Boss material values (fluctuates).

## Stuff I want to change/add
* Skill notes: Barb Helms and Clubs (Unsure if I wanna do Barb skills on Clubs).
* Skill notes: Amazon Bows/Javelins.
* Skill notes: Scepters.
## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
* Can you hide potions? - No. I will not hide them, but you can search for "Change the FILTLVL to 1 less than yours to hide" in the filter to hide them for yourself (just remember to save as ANSI-encoding). Me and multiple of my friends that I made this filter for uses HP/MP pots. They are hidden on the filter level "Ultimate Tryhard".
* PoE sounds? - No tinks for you.
